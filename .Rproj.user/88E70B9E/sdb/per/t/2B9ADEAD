Install R  -- _The programming language_\n2. Install R Studio -- _A fantastic interface for coding in R_\n3. Set up preferences -- _To avoid common mistakes and pitfalls_\n4. Install Packages -- _Adds functionality to R_\n\n\n## Installing R & R Studio\n\nDownload the latest versions of R and R Studio for your flavor of operating system.\n\n* R [http://cran.r-project.org/](http://cran.r-project.org/)\n* R Studio [http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/](http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).\n\nIf you are having difficulty installing these programs here are links to helpful YouTube video on installing both R and R Studio. \n\n- [Mac](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cX532N_XLIs)\n- [Windows](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD07NznguA4)\n\n\n## Layout of R Studio\n\n- The panel in the upper right contains your *workspace* (Environment) as well as a \nhistory of the commands that you've previously entered.  \n- Any plots that you generate will show up in the panel in the lower right corner.\n- There are multiple tabs down there such as your file explorer, and the help files. \n- The panel on the left is the *console* and it's where the action happens.\n\n## The Console\n\n- Everytime you launch RStudio, it will have the same text at the top of the \nconsole telling you the version of R that you're running.  \n- Below that information is the *prompt*, `>` . As its name suggests, this prompt is really a request, a request for a command. \n- Initially, interacting with R is all about typing commands and interpreting the output. \n- These commands and their syntax have evolved over decades (literally) and now provide what many users feel is a fairly natural way to access data and organize, describe, and invoke statistical computations.\n\n\n## Initial Setup\nTo avoid some of the most common errors when learning R let's set some preferences in RStudio. \n\n1. On your computer, create a folder called `RBootcamp`. Store all files associated with this class here.\n2. In RStudio the file menu go to _Tools_ then _Global Options_. \n3. Select your `RBootcamp` folder as your default working directory by clicking [Browse.] and navigating to your `RBootcamp` folder. \n4. Uncheck \"Restore .RData into workspace at startup\" and \"Always save history\"\n5. Where it says 'Save workspace to .RData on exit:\" Select 'Never'\n6. Check\" \"Remove duplicate entries in history\"\n7. Click _apply_ then _ok_. \n\n## Installing Packages \n* Packages are sets of predefined code, functions and data sets. They provide additional functionality and goodies beyond what is included when you download Base R. \n\n* <div class=\"red\">Packages are only installed once per computer ever</div> \n\n* During this course you will be asked to complete several interactive tutorials that use code found in the `swirl` package. \n\n* To install the Swirl package type the following command at the prompt `>` and hit enter to submit the command.\n```{r, eval=FALSE}\ninstall.packages(\"swirl\")\n```\n\n\n## Downloading Swirl lessons\n\n* The `swirl` package and it's fantastic tutorials were created by the folks at [http://swirlstats.com/](http://swirlstats.com/). All of their work is free to use and modify under the GPLv3 copyright license. \n\n* I have spliced and diced the lessons to fit this class. My thanks to them for doing all the hard work. \n\n* Download the [zipped file](https://github.com/norcalbiostat/R-Bootcamp/blob/master/swirl.zip) and place it into your `RBootcamp` folder.\n\n* Leave a window open to this folder. You will need to know the path to this zip file next. \n\n## Installing Swirl lessons\nThe functions used to install the custom lessons are contained within the `swirl` package. \n\nTo get access to these functions you have to load the swirl library and then use the `install_course_zip()` function to install the lessons. \n```{r, eval=FALSE}\nlibrary(swirl)\ninstall_course_zip(\"YOUR PATH HERE/R-Bootcamp/swirl.zip\", multi=TRUE)\n```\n\n* You must change `YOUR PATH HERE` to the path to where your RBootcamp folder is located. \n* Only change the `PATH`. \n* Be sure all slashes are forward `/`\n\n## Finding your path on a Mac\n\n1. Select the file or folder in the OS X Finder, then hit Command+i to summon Get Info\n2. Get Info can also be accessed by the control-click and right-click menus.\n3. Click and drag alongside “Where” to select the path, then hit Command+C to copy the full path to the clipboard \n4. Paste this into `R` for your path. \n\n\n[Reference website](http://osxdaily.com/2013/06/19/copy-file-folder-path-mac-os-x/)\n\n\n## Finding your path on Windows\n\n1. Open Windows Explorer and browse to the folder or file of your choice.\n2. The path to the folder/file will be indicated in the Address bar of Windows Explorer.\n3. To copy it, simply right-click on the Address bar and select _Copy address as text_.\n4. Paste this into `R` for your path. \n\n\n[Reference website](http://ccm.net/faq/31588-windows-8-easily-copy-the-full-path-of-a-file-folder)\n\n\n## Using Swirl\nThat's material for Lab 1. \n\nGo download it from [here](here) and start working on it. \n\nDon't forget to use the [Piazza](link to piazza course) if you get stuck.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
