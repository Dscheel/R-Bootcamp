# R Bootcamp - To Do
 
* Get Ian & Daniel added as TA to Piazza - get him to add contact info

* Need: Links to BBLearn (can I do quizzes on piazza?)
* Email CSUC for faculty website -- get this hosted there (then yay get to update all links yet again)
* -- how to use relative paths for web links so course is portable?

	
* Update labs to say that "typing bye() will save their progress mid lesson"
* rename zip file to R-Bootcamp
