# Introduction 
The goal of this lab is to introduce you to how to extract certain elements from a data vector in R. You will complete one Swirl lessons and some additional exercises specified in this lab. You can stop and restart the `swirl()` lesson at any time, just type `bye()` to save your progress before exiting. Be sure to use the same name each time so you pick up where you left off. At the end of the lesson you will have the option to send me an email letting me know you have completed the lesson. **Do this so I can give you credit!**


## Subsetting vectors using positional indicators and the bracket `[]` notation. 

Complete the **Subsetting Vectors** Swirl lesson. 

### Practice

1. Create a vector of 
2. 

## Subsetting vectors using `subset()`. 

As you start to learn `R` you will quickly realize that there are multiple ways to write code
that achieves the desired result. In general it comes down to experience, preference, and style.
In this lab we will cover another way to subset the data using the function `subset()`.

1. Read the help file for subset by typing `?subset`. Don't worry if it seems cryptic

### Practice

1. Create a vector of 
2. 


### Assessment
Complete the **Subsetting Vectors** quiz on BBLearn.
<!-- What is head(x) equal to?  x[1:6] -->
<!-- What is the equivelant notation to subset(x[x>0])? x[x>0 & !is.na(x)] -->
<!-- What does subset() do? Return subsets of vectors, matrices or data frames which meet conditions. -->
